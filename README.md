**What's my main goal?**

Create a massive database of projects and articles that showcase my expansive expertise so I can apply to any job and/or get a client on the fly.

**What specific areas of expertise need to be showcased?**

- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Node
- [ ] Vue
- [ ] WordPress
- [ ] React
- [ ] Shopify
- [ ] Vite
- [ ] Typography
- [ ] Accessibility

...and many more but just focus on these for now. Reference your notes for later. 

## Nerd Stuff

### Run this in the 1st terminal

* npm intall
* npm start

### Run this in the 2nd terminal

* npx decap-server

### Adding to Netlify

* Add new site from GitHub repo
* Make "public" the build folder
* Go to "Identity" panel
* Set registration to "invite only"
* Set your external providers to "GitHub"
  * Maybe add "Google" later
* Enable Git Gateway
* To add users go to Integrations > Identity > Netlify Identity... then "add user"

### When Setting Post Types...

* Alter the CMS info by just search "Post..." and update to new names
* Watch out for kebab cases
* So far they have to be manually modified in it's dedicated collection, "list" module, and navigation collection
* Rename the CSS files as well
* Route to the right layout in the config

### No default JSON for MetaData

* Just write it in the CMS. Too much work with the meta cascade for every page

## Notes

### Things to do

- [x] Pages
- [x] Post Types
- [x] Navigation
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] Basic Styling
- [ ] Content

**...and I'm stuck**

I'm stalled on modules. I need to get the content first... So... this is a game of bare bones writing. After that I can make decisions on how to model it.

Let's go back to basics without entirely ditching the project but instead refactoring it. 

* Research
* Strategize
* Design
* Code

## Research

I got the site architecture nailed down. I got the CMS working. It's hard to style when you don't know the content though. Content is king. 

So far the only thing I implimented from my research is by converting the php portfolio framework to 11ty w/ Decap CMS. 

Right now I have a solid collections of resources of help me reach my goals so I'll focus on each page of the site and strategize.

## Content Strategy
